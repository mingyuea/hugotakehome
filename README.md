To run this project, first please make sure to install all relevant packages. If required, run
`npm run prisma` to generate the correct Prisma schemas. Then run `npm run start` to start both the
server and client. The client can still be found at `http://localhost:5173/` and the server at
`http://localhost:8000`. The project uses the SQLite db that was provisioned with the original setup
and requires no additional db setup.
